# Instructions: 

Create a new folder in your `web-development` folder called `step-06.html`. Place the following contents in to the file and save:

~~~
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Step 01: Line Breaks </title>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>
~~~

Open this is Chrome - but make sure you can also see the file in Sublime as well. With the HTML code below, copy it into the `<body>` - and verify that it displays in chrome as shown in the links below.



##Line Break

The `<br>` tag adds a carriage return. The text continues on the next line.

HTML Code
~~~
This is an example of a line break at the end of the line. <br> As you can see the text continues at the beginning of the next line with no extra space

Note:The break tag is an empty tag which means that it has no end tag.

##Lines (Horizontal Rules)
Lines can be used to separate thoughts or ideas. You can add a horizontal line (also called a horizontal rule) to a page using the `<hr>` tag.

Note: The `<hr>` tag is an empty tag and thus has no closing tag.
