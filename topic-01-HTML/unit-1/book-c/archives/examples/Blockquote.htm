<h3>The Search Continues</h3>
<p>Concerning the search for ever smaller sub-atomic particles, Werner Heisenberg has observed,
</p>
<blockquote>
By getting to smaller and smaller units, we do not come to fundamental units, or indivisible
units, but we do come to a point where division has no meaning.
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, reductionism fails to help us explain real-world events.  As Paul Davies, one of England's leading theoreticians, has noted,
</p>
<blockquote>
It would be ludicrous to try to understand consciousness, or a living cell, or even an inanimate system such as a tornado, in terms of quarks, for example.
</blockquote>
<p>The difficulty of explaining what is made up of what at the sub-atomic scale is illustrated by an aspect of the Heisenburg uncertainty principle . . .
