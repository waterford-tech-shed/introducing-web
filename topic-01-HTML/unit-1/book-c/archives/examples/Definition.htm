<h2>Famous Scientists</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Michael Faraday</dt>
<dd>
An English chemist and physicist, Michael Faraday (1791-1867) discovered the principle of electromagnetic induction in 1831. By moving a magnet through a coil of copper wire, he found that it caused an electric current to flow through the wire. The electric motor and electric generator are based on this principle.</dd>
<dt>Guglielmo Marconi</dt>
<dd>An Italian inventor and electrical engineer, Guglielmo Marconi (1874-1937) pioneered the use of wireless telegraphy. Telegraph signals had previously been sent through electrical wires. In 1895, Marconi demonstrated that telegraph signals could also be sent through the air.</dd>
<dt>James Clerk Maxwell</dt>
<dd>A British scientist, James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) is best known for his research on electricity and magnetism and for his kinetic theory of gases.  In 1864, Maxwell combined his ideas with those of  Michael Faraday and others to form a theory describing the relationship between electric and magnetic fields. He theorized that waves in the combined fields, called electromagnetic waves, travel at the speed of light.</dd>
