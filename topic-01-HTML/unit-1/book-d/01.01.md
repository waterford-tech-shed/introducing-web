##Image

To add an image to a web page, we use the `<img>` tag. It requires at least two attributes (src and alt).

HTML Code
~~~
<p> <img src="images/atitlan.jpg" alt="Lake Atitlan, Guatemala" width="300" height="240"> </p>
~~~

<a href="archives/examples/example12.htm" target="_blank">Image Example</a>

<a href="archives/examples/myimage.htm" target="_blank">Another Image Example</a>

###The img tag attributes:

The **src** or **source** attribute tells the browser what image (ie. image file) goes in the tag and where to find it. It is required. The browser sends instructions to the server to go to the folder named images, get the file called atitlan.jpg (in this example) and send it back to the client (ie. your computer) and show it in the space reserved by the image tag.

The **alt** attribute refers to alternative text or text that the W3C calls "fallback content". This too is required. If for some reason visitors can't see an image the alt attribute explains what the image is.

While the **height** and **width** are not required, they are highly recommended. Pages don't load all at once. When a new page opens a browser will start to load what it can, when it can and often images finish downloading last. With the height and width attributes set the browser can position (with CSS) and size the img tag before the image file loads.
