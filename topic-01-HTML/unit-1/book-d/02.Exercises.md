##Adding an image: Exercise

Create a folder called 'Lab01c' in your WebDevelopment folder. Within this folder, create a folder called 'images' - you will save your images into this folder.

Next, copy the code below into your text editor. Save the file as index.html, in the Lab02 folder.

~~~
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Exercise 02</title>
</head>
<body>


</body>
</html>
~~~

Now, carry out the following formatting instructions. Add HTML tags in the correct places throughout the code.

- Create a heading with your name.
- Then an add an image element with the following attributes:
  - source (src) images/jack.gif
  - alt: Picture of Jack
  - width:80
  - height:120
- Save the jack.gif image into your lab02/images folder. You can download the jack.gif image by clicking [here](archives/examples/images/jack.gif) and then right-clicking the image and selecting "Save image as..."
- Write a short paragraph about Jack. In your description, highlight some words in italics.
- Add a horizontal line.
- Add a quotation (Anyone who has lost track of time when using a computer knows the propensity to dream, the urge to make dreams come true and the tendency to miss lunch.) from Tim Berners-Lee.
- And, finally add a little copyright statement. From the class notes, find the code for the copyright symbol and insert it as shown.
