##Links

Hyperlinks, or links, are how you move around the web. An `<a>` or anchor tag is how you make hyperlinks in HTML. Hyperlinks are basically pointers to other information on the World Wide Web. The other sites might be a file in the same directory, in Japan or anywhere in the world. The syntax varies a little depending on what kind of connection is required to visit the proposed site.

###URLs

URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. A URL, basically, is a way to tell your web browser (or other program) where to look for something. If you wanted to make a hypertext link to a page, you would need its URL.

For Example: the URL for Microsoft is `http://www.microsoft.com`

##External links

To make the actual link to the Microsoft page, you would see something like this: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> - a word that is clickable. This is accomplished with the following HTML code:

~~~
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>
~~~

###'target' attribute

If you want an external link to open in a new tab (so the user doesn't leave your website!) you can use the target attribute, as follows:

~~~
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>
~~~
