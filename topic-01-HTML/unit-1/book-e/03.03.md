##Linking within the same page

An anchor is a point in a web page that you wish to go to. You mark the section using the following: `<a href = "#name">` where #name is the name of the section.

###Example of setting an anchor

This code sets this piece of text at the top of the page as an anchor, and gives it the name "top".
~~~
<a name="top">Hi! I'm the first piece of text on this page!!!</a>
~~~

###Linking to that anchor

Then, later on, we can link to this area of the page using the hash symbol and the name we defined (so #top). This is done as follows:
~~~
<p>I'm way, way, way down at the bottom of the page... Too lazy to scroll back up? That's okay! Click here: 
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
~~~
