## Mail to links

To email a contact address from a web page, use `<a href = "mailto:email address">` where email address is the address of the contact you wish to email. For example:

~~~
<a href="mailto:webdev@wit.ie">Send me a comment</a>
~~~

When clicked, this will open up the computer's default mail program and start an email to the address you specified. If it doesn't work on the PCs in the lab you're in, it might be because there isn't a default mail program set.
