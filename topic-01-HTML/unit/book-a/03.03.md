#Introduction Project

You will create a simple web page for it Starbuzz Coffee shop. The brief for the project has been sketched on a napkin!

These are the steps you should carry out:


- Create a folder for the project called `starbuzz`
- Inside the folder, create a file called `index.html`

Here is how Sublime might look if you do the above:

Now we enter the following contents into the (blank) index.html file:

Now, we would like to view the file we have just saved using a web browser (Chrome in this case). This can normally be done just by double clicking on the file in Explorer:

This is a web rendering of the file we created. It doesnt look very pretty -  we will improve it in the next step...
