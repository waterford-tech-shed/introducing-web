# Setup

Make sure you have downloaded and installed Sublime Text 3 from

 - <http://www.sublimetext.com/>

Select the appropriate download for your laptop (OS, Windows, Linux). You do not need to purchase Sublime. It will occasionally ask for a contribution, but it will never expire or become unusable.

This site has some useful tutorial videos in how to use Sublime Text. There is no need to subscribe to view the full course. However, the first 2 videos are free, and provide a useful introduction to this application:

 - [Sublime Tutorial](http://code.tutsplus.com/courses/perfect-workflow-in-sublime-text-2)

You are free to use any browser you are comfortable with. In this course, any screen shots will usually be taken from the Chrome browser. Firefox or Safari would be equally fine.

There is another lab - which we worked through during the induction session:

- <https://tutors-design.netlify.com/lab/wit-hdip-comp-sci-2020-web-development.netlify.com/topic-00-overview/unit-a-course-review/book-a>

It might be worth working through this lab if you did not complete it yet. Alternatively, you could look carefully at this particular step:

- <https://tutors-design.netlify.com/lab/wit-hdip-comp-sci-2020-web-development.netlify.com/topic-00-overview/unit-a-course-review/book-a/02>

Which has important information regarding the configuration of Windows File Explorer. Once you had located the settings outlined in that step, you could start this lab.
