# Instructions: 

Create a new folder in your `web-development` folder called `step-01.html`. Place the following contents in to the file and save:

~~~
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Step 01</title>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>
~~~

Open this is Chrome - but make sure you can also see the file in Sublime as well. With the HTML code below, copy it into the `<body>` - and verify that it displays in chrome as shown in the links below.


#Formatting

This section will introduce tags used to format text on a web page. First up: paragraphs and headings.


##Paragraph Break

A paragraph break adds a carriage return and leaves a blank line.

HTML Code
~~~
<p>This is an example of a paragraph break. </p> <p>As you can see the text continues at the beginning of the next line with a blank line in between.</p>
~~~

##Header Tags

Headers are usually used for headings. They range in size from 1-6, with one being largest and 6 being smallest. The header tag automatically issues an invisible paragraph tag. Therefore, you cannot have two different header sizes on one line.

`<h#>` TEXT `</h#>` where # is a number (1-6)

HTML Code
~~~
<h1> Welcome </h1>
<h2> Welcome </h2>
<h3> Welcome </h3>
<h4> Welcome </h4>
<h5> Welcome </h5>
<h6> Welcome </h6>
~~~
