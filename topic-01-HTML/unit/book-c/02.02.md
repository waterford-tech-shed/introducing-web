##Bold Text

There are 2 ways to make text bold in most browsers: using the using the `<strong>` tag or using the `<b>` tag.
The `<strong>` tag represents "strong importance for its content". The `<b>` tag represents a section of text that is "stylistically offset from the normal prose without conveying any extra importance". You can use `<b>` for key words, or the lead sentence in an article.

HTML Code
~~~
<p>If you want to write semantic code <strong>it is important that you understand the differences</strong>!</p>
<p><b>It was nearly one o clock </b>when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion.</p>

Note:Use `<b>` when you want the text to have a different style without contextual importance, but use `<strong>` when you want the text to have extra importance from a content perspective.


##Italicized Text

The HTML `<em>` tag is used for indicating emphasis. The `<em>` tag surrounds the word/term being emphasised. Can be used for words or sentences you would pronounce differently. The HTML `<i>` tag represents text that's in an alternate voice or mood, or otherwise offset from the normal prose. You could use the `<i>` tag for foreign words, or technical terms.
