# Instructions: 

Create a new folder in your `web-development` folder called `step-03.html`. Place the following contents in to the file and save:

~~~
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Step 03: Comments</title>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>
~~~

Open this is Chrome - but make sure you can also see the file in Sublime as well. With the HTML code below, copy it into the `<body>` - and verify that it displays in chrome as shown in the links below.



##Comments

~~~
< !-- ... -->

Comments are a way for programmers to write notes to themselves or to others that might be looking at the code. It is much like the REM (Remark) statement in a basic program. There are times (especially if there are new commands) that it is a good idea to leave instruction as to the location of a file or the techniques used to obtain a rather difficult command. Again, the comments do not show up when being displayed.

The comments are not displayed in the browser.

Comment Example
~~~
< !-- Comments should be written as follows: Left-angle bracket, exclamation point and two dashes to start; two dashes and right-angle bracket to end. Comments are ignored by the browser. -->
