Comments are a way for programmers to write notes to themselves or to others that might be looking at the code. It is much like the REM (Remark) statement in a basic program. There are times (especially if there are new commands) that it is a good idea to leave instruction as to the location of a file or the techniques used to obtain a rather difficult command. Again, the comments do not show up when being displayed.

The comments are not displayed in the browser.
