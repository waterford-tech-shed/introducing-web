# Instructions: 

Create a new folder in your `web-development` folder called `step-05.html`. Place the following contents in to the file and save:

~~~
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Step 05: Symbols </title>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>
~~~

Open this is Chrome - but make sure you can also see the file in Sublime as well. With the HTML code below, copy it into the `<body>` - and verify that it displays in chrome as shown in the links below.


##Symbols

Occasionally, you may need to include the greater than (>) or less than (<) symbols in the text of your web pages. The problem is that these symbols are also used to denote tags in HTML. To solve this problem, we use special little codes called entities in our text instead of these symbols. For example, the entity for the "greater than" symbol is `&gt;`.

###Some common entites:

Experiment with some of these symbols below:

- Greater than symbol (>): `&gt;` 
- Less than symbol (<): `&lt;`
- Euro symbol (€): `&euro;`
- Copyright symbol (©): `&copy;` 
- Trademark symbol (™): `&trade;` 

Use any passage of text you like (in a new paragraph).

###Entity reference:

To find out the entity code for any symbol, use this reference:
