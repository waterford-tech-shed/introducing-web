##Symbols

Occasionally, you may need to include the greater than (>) or less than (<) symbols in the text of your web pages. The problem is that these symbols are also used to denote tags in HTML. To solve this problem, we use special little codes called entities in our text instead of these symbols. For example, the entity for the "greater than" symbol is `&gt;`.

###Some common entites:

- Greater than symbol (>): `&gt;` 
- Less than symbol (<): `&lt;`
- Euro symbol (€): `&euro;`
- Copyright symbol (©): `&copy;` 
- Trademark symbol (™): `&trade;` 

###Entity reference:

To find out the entity code for any symbol, use this reference:
