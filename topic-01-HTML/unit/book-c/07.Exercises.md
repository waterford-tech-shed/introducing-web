    Formatting Exercise
    We can format words using the &lt;b&gt; tag for bold or the &lt;i&gt; tag for italic.    
    We can even nest the tags like so &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - now do you see? But
    be careful always close the inner tag first.

    The original context of the saying O tempora, o mores is the following:

    O tempora, o mores!
    Senatus haec intellegit. consul videt; hic tamen vivit.  
    Vivit? immo vero etiam in senatum venit, fit publici consilii particeps,
    notat et designat oculis ad caedem unum quemque nostrum.

Now, carry out the following formatting instructions. Add HTML tags in the correct places throughout the code.

- Mark up Formatting Exercise as an h3 heading. 
- Mark up the first two paragraphs using the p tag.
- In the first paragraph, boldface the word bold, and italicise the word italic. 
- Also, in the first paragraph, boldface and italicise the words – now do you see?
- In the second paragraph boldface the words O tempora, o mores.
- The third paragraph (i.e. the latin sentence O tempora, o mores! Senatus …) needs to be marked up as a blockquote.
- Save and Preview.
