#CSS Rules

Currently our CSS file looks like this:

~~~css
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

h1, h2 {
  color: gray
}

h1 {
  border-bottom: 1px solid black;
}
~~~

Which produces the following style for the index page:

![](./img/11x.png)


Add the following element around the text "great prices" in the first paragraph of the index.html page:

~~~html
      <em>great prices</em>
~~~

This uses the `<em>` element, which introduces an emphasis style:

- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em>

You may be able to see that this text is in italics.

We can introduce the following rule into our stylesheet to target this specific element:

~~~css
em {
  color:red;
}
~~~

Save the stylesheet and refresh the page in the browser. The text `great prices` should be in italics and coloured red.

When experimenting with CSS, we often want to experiment with the effects we are introducing. Specifically, introducing some rules, and then perhaps removing them again to see the difference (if any).

Take the body rule in your stylesheet and 'comment out' the font rule:

~~~css
body {
  /*font-family:sans-serif;*/
}
~~~

Save and reload. You should be able to notice the difference. This is called 'commenting' and is a common technique in both programming and web development. 

'Uncomment' the rule again (remove the `/*` and `*/` symbols).
