#Colours

Web colours are specified in terms of how much red, green, and blue make up the colour. You specify the amount of each colour from 0 to 100% and then add them all together to arrive at a final colour.

You can use the names of colours - and CSS permits a very broad range of colour values:

## Specifying Colour using colour names

The most straightforward way to describe a colour in CSS is just to use its name. For example to specify "silver" as the background colour of a body element:

~~~css
body {
  background-color: silver;
}
~~~

Note you must spell the word colour in the american way: "color"

## Specify in red, green and blue values.

If you want to specify an orange colour which consists of 80% red, 40% green and 0% blue:

~~~css
body {
  background-color: rgb(80%, 40%, 0%);
}
~~~

or you can specify it as numeric values between 0 and 255. So 80% of 255 is 204, 40% of 255 is 102, and 0% of 255 is 0.

~~~css
body {
  background-color: rgb(204, 102, 0);
}
~~~

## Specify colour using hex codes.

Each set of two digits of a hex code represents the red, green and blue of the colour. The first two represent red, the second two green and the last two blue.

~~~css 
body {
  background-color:  #cc6600;
}
~~~

Both keyword and hex code values are listed here (as above) :
