#Font, Colour & Line Height

In your current style.css, change your CSS file so it now contains the following:

~~~css
body {
  font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  font-size: small;
}

h1, h2 {
  color: #007e7e;
  border-bottom: 1px solid black;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 150%;
}

h2 {
  font-size: 130%;
}

p {
  color: maroon;
}
~~~

The default font family is sans-serif, this is last in the list, the others are alternatives. Save the file and load the home web page in your browser. The headings should now be in sans-serif and an aquamarine colour. The paragraph text is also sans-serif as all elements inherit the `<body>`s font-family property.

We now want to adjust the line height of the text on the entire page so that there's more vertical space between each line. To do that we add a line-height property in the existing body rule.

~~~css
body
{
  /* as before */
  line-height: 1.6em;
}
~~~

This property allows us to specify the line height between each line. Like other font-related properties, you can specify the height in pixels, or using an em or percentage value that's relative to the font size. Save your CSS file and reload your web pages to see the change.

Try a few different line heights like 200%, .5em, and 20px to see the effect. Change the height back to 1.6em when you are finished.

Leave the style sheet looking like this:

~~~
body {
  font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  font-size: small;
  line-height: 1.6em;
}

h1, h2 {
  color: #007e7e;
  border-bottom: 1px solid black;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 150%;
}

h2 {
  font-size: 130%;
}

p {
  color: maroon;
}
~~~
