# Relative Paths II

This is the deals page now:

~~~
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>App Bundle Deals</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="../style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Weekly Deals</h1>
    <h2>Business Bundle</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="images/business.png" alt="Business Bundle"> Here comes the
      next bundle for march. This time it's macware who publish a bundle. The so
      called macware Business Bundle contains 6 apps at a price of only $29.99
      instead of $199.94. So you can save around 84%.
    </p>
    <h2>Insanity Deal</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="images/insanity.jpg" alt="Insanity Deal"> With the new $5
      Insanity Deals from Bundlehunt you receive every day a highly reduced app
      for $5 only with savings up to 75%. Not a real bundle but, as there are
      multiple apps for only $5 each, one new per day, for the days to come.
    </p>
    <a href="index.html">Home</a>
  </body>
</html>

Open the page in a browser, and try the "Home" link:

This is a broken link, easily fixed in this instance:

~~~
    <a href="../index.html">Home</a>
~~~

## Image Links

This images needed for this page:

![](./img/business.png)
![](./img/insanity.jpg)

Download and save them into the images folder in the project.

This will not be sufficient to get the images linked however. The image tags still do not have the correct path:

~~~
  ...
    <img src="images/business.png" alt="Business Bundle">
  ...
    <img src="images/insanity.jpg" alt="Insanity Deal"> 
  ...
~~~

Try correcting the link as shown:

~~~
  ...
    <img src="../images/business.png" alt="Business Bundle">
  ...
    <img src="../images/insanity.jpg" alt="Insanity Deal"> 
  ...
~~~

The page should render correctly now:
