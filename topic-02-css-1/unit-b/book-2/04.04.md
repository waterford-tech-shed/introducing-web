    <h2>Business Bundle</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="../images/business.png" alt="Business Bundle"> Here comes the
      next bundle for march. This time it's macware who publish a bundle. The so
      called macware Business Bundle contains 6 apps at a price of only $29.99
      instead of $199.94. So you can save around 84%.
    </p>
    <h2>Insanity Deal</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="../images/insanity.jpg" alt="Insanity Deal"> With the new $5
      Insanity Deals from Bundlehunt you receive every day a highly reduced app
      for $5 only with savings up to 75%. Not a real bundle but, as there are
      multiple apps for only $5 each, one new per day, for the days to come.

Modify the two `<h2>` elements as follows:

~~~
  ...
    <h2 class="special">Business Bundle</h2>
  ...
    <h2 class="special">Insanity Deal</h2>
  ...
~~~

We are 'marking' these elements - this will have no difference on the current display:

Back in our style sheet, include this extra rule:

~~~
.special {
  color: red;
}
~~~

Save, and reload the page:

The targeted headings should be red.
