#HTML pages

We are going to create a web site that is based on the Google Play site or the Apple app store. It will present apps, music, and movies to the user.

Choose New File from the File menu, to create another new file called  `apps.html`

You should now have the following folder and file structure visible in Sublime:

Make sure your sublime matches the above precisely.

Next you will write some html code into the two html files. 

Copy and paste in the following code into each of the files:

##index.html
~~~
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Bundle APP Store</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="images/banner.png">
    <h1>Welcome to the App Bundle Store</h1>
    <p>

      broad range of suppliers and combine them into great deals. These are the highest quality apps

Do the pages look more or less as above?

Specifically:

- Do the images display correctly?
- Does the link in the index page work, opening the apps page from the index page? The link is embedded in the second paragraph.
- If you navigate from index to app, how do you get back?
