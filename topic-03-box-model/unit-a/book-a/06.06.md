# div

Open the main index page and introduce a new `<div>` element, wrapping most (but not all) elements in `<body>` (exclude the first `<img>` element):

~~~html
  <body>
    <img src="images/banner.png" />
    <div>

Notice the indentation - where each element is to move in by 2 spaces consistently, is not followed above: the elements inside `<div>` should be indented. We can do this easily in sublime as follows.

First, select all the elements inside the div:

![](img/24x.png)

The press 'tab' once, it should move the elements in 2 spaces, preserving the indentation of the enclosed elements.

Still in sublime, experiment with the 'folding' behaviour by folding the entire `<div>` 

![](img/29x.png)

This is triggered by hovering the pointer over the left margin until arrows appear, and then using these arrows to alter how the editor displays the html. This, of course, is just a convenience feature - the actual text is not altered. Explore the `Edit->Code Folding` submenu for more options.

Immediately below this section, introduce this new section:

~~~html
    <div>
      <h1>Weekly Deals</h1>
      <h2 class="special">Business Bundle</h2>
      <p>
        <img src="images/business.png" alt="Business Bundle"/> Here comes the
        next bundle for march. This time it's macware who publish a bundle. The so
        called macware Business Bundle contains 6 apps at a price of only $29.99
        instead of $199.94. So you can save around 84%.
      </p>
      <h2 class="special">Insanity Deal</h2>
      <p>
        <img src="images/insanity.jpg" alt="Insanity Deal"/> With the new $5
        Insanity Deals from Bundlehunt you receive every day a highly reduced app
        for $5 only with savings up to 75%. Not a real bundle but, as there are
        multiple apps for only $5 each, one new per day, for the days to come.
      </p>
      <h3>Onesoft Bundle</h3>
      <p>
        <img src="images/ondesoft.jpg" alt="One Soft Bundle"/>

        $199.94. So you can save around 84%. Get it today!
      </p>
    </div>
~~~

This is already wrapped in a `<div>`.

The page now looks like this:

![](img/10x.png)

Finally, give each of these sections an id:

~~~html
    <div id="maincontent">
      ...
    </div>
    <div id="sidebar">
      ...
    </div>
~~~

This is the complete page at this stage:

~~~html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Bundle APP Store</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
