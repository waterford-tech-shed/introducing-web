# Grid Items

The term 'Grid Container' refers to  our outer enclosing div - called 'container' - in our page:

~~~html
   <img src="images/banner.png"/>
   <div class="container">
     <div id="maincontent">
        ...
     </div>
     <div id="sidebar">
        ...
     </div>
   </div>
~~~


The two division contained within this - call "maincontent" and "sidebar" we can consider to be "Grid Items" - i.e. elements to be placed inside a grid according to some rules we define.

The rules for their placement are defined in the css rule we defined:

~~~css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 70% 30%;
}
~~~

You will notice that the left and right margins of our page are right up against the browser window edges. We might like to strive for a more pleasing set of dimensions with the following adjustment to the rule:

~~~
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 10% 60% 20% 10%;
}
~~~

This is defining 4 columns instead of 2. Reload the page and see what effect it has.

Not quite what we were looking for - out grid children went directly into the 10% and 60% columns.

Here are new rules to fix this:

~~~css
#maincontent {
  grid-column-start: 2;
}

#sidebar {
  grid-column-start: 3;
}
~~~

These rules define in which column (of four) the child is to be displayed. It should look a little better now:

Here is a revised version of the container rule:

~~~css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 5% 55% 20% 5%;
  grid-gap: 5%;
}
~~~

Notice we have a "grid-gap" of 5%. Also notice, we have had to 'make room' for this in the columns so that the four columns (total 85%) + the three gaps (15%) adds up to 100%.

The page now looks like this:

Still not quite finished - but almost there.
