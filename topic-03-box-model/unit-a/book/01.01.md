#Adding behaviour (methods) to Spot

We have seen how the fields are used in classes (i.e. xCoord, yCoord, diameter).
We now look at the behaviour (methods) in classes.    

**Note:**  The version of Spot below doesn't enforce the encapsulation rules yet.  We will implement these rules in SpotV7.0 (consistent with how we did it in lectures).  We will bring in Encapsulation in Step04 of this lab when we add the accessors and mutators.


##Spot V4.0 - display() method

Create a new Processing sketch in your workspace and call it **Spot_Version4_0**.

Create a new **Spot** tab and cut and paste the following code into it:

~~~java
class Spot{
  float xCoord, yCoord;
  float diameter;
  
  Spot()
  {
  }
  
  Spot(float xPos, float yPos, float diamtr)
  {
    xCoord = xPos;
    yCoord = yPos;
    diameter = diamtr;
  }
}

~~~             


Then write this new method into the above class:

~~~java
  void display()
  {
    ellipse(xCoord, yCoord, diameter, diameter);
  }
  
~~~


In the *main* tab, cut and paste the following code into it:

~~~ java
Spot sp;

void setup()
{
  size (100,100);
  noStroke();
  sp = new Spot(33, 50, 30);
}

void draw()
{
  background(0);
  sp.display();
}

~~~          


Run your code.  You should get the following output:

Save your work (don't close the project though).
