#Adding behaviour (methods) to Spot

We will continue looking at the behaviour (methods) in classes.    

**Note:**  The version of Spot below doesn't enforce the encapsulation rules yet.  We will implement these rules in SpotV7.0 (consistent with how we did it in lectures).  We will bring in Encapsulation in Step04 of this lab when we add the accessors and mutators.


##Spot V5.0 - colour() method

Save your **Spot_Version4_0** as **Spot_Version5_0**.

Add the following fields to the Spot class 

~~~java
  int red, green, blue, gray;
~~~

Type in the following colour() method code to the Spot class:

~~~java 
void colour(int redVal, int greenVal, int blueVal)
  {
    red = redVal;
    green = greenVal;
    blue = blueVal;
    fill (red, green, blue);
  }
~~~

and then in the *main* tab, refactor the draw() method to: 

~~~java 
void draw()
{
  background(0);
  sp.colour(255,10,20);
  sp.display();
}
~~~
