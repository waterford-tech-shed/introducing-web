#Spot V6.x

In this step, we will introduce the *move* method and also start using the *this* keyword.

**Note:**  The version of Spot below doesn't enforce the encapsulation rules yet.  We will implement these rules in SpotV7.0 (consistent with how we did it in lectures).  We will bring in Encapsulation in Step04 of this lab when we add the accessors and mutators.


##Spot V6.0 - Adding a move() method

Save your **Spot_Version5_3** work as **Spot_Version6_0**.

Type in the following extra method code in your Spot class:

~~~java
   void move(float xPos, float yPos)
   {
     xCoord = xPos;
     yCoord = yPos;
   }
~~~

and then in the *main* tab, refactor the draw() method to: 

~~~java
Spot sp;

void setup()
{
  size (100,100);
  noStroke();
  sp = new Spot(33, 50, 30, 125);
}

void draw()
{
  background(0);
  sp.display();
  sp.move(mouseX, mouseY);
}
~~~

Run the code.
