#Exercise


##Exercise 1 

Using [Spot Version 7.1](archives/Spot_Version7_1.zip) as a starting point, save this as **lab04b_exercise_01**.

Implement these validation rules in the relevant constructors and setters:

- xCoord and yCoord values must be in the range 0..100.
- if an invalid value is supplied at constructor level, give a default of 50.
- if an invalid value is supplied at setter level, don't default.

For testing, use the same appraoch we applied to testing the diameter validation.


##DRY principle

Now you can really see how we have repeated ourselves throughout our code.  As we become more familiar with Java, we will working on writing utility / helper methods to reduce this repetition!
