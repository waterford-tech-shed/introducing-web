#Challenge

##Challenge 1 

Using your latest working version of the Spot project as a starting point [or our solution to the previous exercise](archives/lab04b_exercise_01.zip), save it as **lab04b_challenge_01**.

In Spot, write a method called **grow** that takes in one float parameter (growthPixels).  The return type of this method is void.  

In the *main* tab, in the draw method, call the **grow** method, passing out a value as a parameter.

Run your code.  If you passed a positive number in grow, you should see your circle growing each time the draw() method is called, if you passed a negative value, you should see your circle shrinking.  To verfiy that the diameter is changing, you could print out the value stored in it (using getDiameter).

Data Integrity:  Did you consider data integrity when writing the draw method?  What we mean by this is...else where in the Spot class, we restricted the diameter to a range of 20 to 50 inclusive.  Did you remember to do this in the new method, *grow*?  If not, refactor your method to make sure that the diameter doesn't breach these bounds.
