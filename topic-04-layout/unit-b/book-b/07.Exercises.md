#Exercises

This is the project as completed in this lab:

- <https://github.com/wit-hdip-comp-sci-2019/grid-layout/releases/tag/lab.03b.end>

## Exercise : Web Site

Here is a version of this lab, expanded to multiple pages and including images:

- [Layout Site](https://wit-hdip-comp-sci-2019.github.io/grid-layout-v1/home.html)

See if you can extend the site you have built in this lab to include some of the features exhibited here. Specifically :

- 3 pages in total
- All linked using the 'navigation' section as demonstrated
- A sample set of images at different positions on the pages

The content from this site was generated here:

 - <http://www.lipsum.com>

The solution project to this is here:

However! - give your self perhaps 30 minutes to try building the site yourself first before peeking at the solution project.
