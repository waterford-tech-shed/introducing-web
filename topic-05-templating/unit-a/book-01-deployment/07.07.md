# Removing Web Sites from Surge

If you have published a number of sites you may want to recall what domains were generated, or perhaps remove some or all of the published pages.

The various commands are listed here:

- <https://surge.sh/help>

To list all web sites:

~~~
C:\dev\iot-web>surge list
              email: youremail@domain.com
              token: *****************

      iot-1.surge.sh
      dull-pet.surge.sh
      highfalutin-exchange.surge.sh


C:\dev\iot-web>
~~~

To remove (delete) a site from the server use the `teardown` command:

~~~
C:\dev\iot-web>surge teardown highfalutin-exchange.surge.sh
              email: youremail@domain.com
              token: *****************
             domain: highfalutin-exchange.surge.sh

    Success - highfalutin-exchange.surge.sh has been removed.


C:\dev\iot-web>
~~~
