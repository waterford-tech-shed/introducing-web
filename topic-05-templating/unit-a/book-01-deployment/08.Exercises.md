#Exercises

See if you can deploy one of your other lab projects using surge. Perhaps the 'bundle store' project from lab03a.

Here are the steps you will need to do this:

# 1: Verify harp & surge installed

Make sure you have the node+harp+surge packages installed on your computer. Open a command prompt and enter

~~~
node -v
harp -V
~~~

# 2: Prepare Project Folder

Create a new (empty) folder to contain your project. Into this folder place the following file:

## harp.json

~~~
{
  "globals": 
  {

  }
}
~~~

#3: Copy Project Files

Place your entire project into a folder called `public` inside this project folder (as we did in step 05).

#4: Run the Server

From the command line, enter the command:

~~~
harp server
~~~

#5: Verify Site

Verify that your side it available on:

- <http://localhost:9000>

If your site has 'index.html' as its main page, then the above link will work. If the main page is named something else, then you will need to append the correct file name. E.g.:

- <http://localhost:9000/home>

#6: Publish Site

Terminate the server with ^C, and then enter:

~~~
harp compile
surge
~~~

This will deploy the web site:

~~~
  project path: G:\dev\iot-web\
               size: 34 files, 2.3 MB
             domain: XXX.surge.sh
             upload: [====================] 100%, eta: 0.0s
   propagate on CDN: [====================] 100%
               plan: Free
              users: youremail@domain.com
         IP address: 192.241.214.148

    Success! Project is published and running at XXX.surge.sh
~~~

#7: Verify Deployment

Verify that the site is available on the domain. You will have the opportunity to change the domain `XXX`
