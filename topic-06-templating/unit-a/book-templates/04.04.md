# Ejs Layouts

Create a new file in the project:

## `_layout.ejs`

~~~
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Bundle APP Store</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/home.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="images/banner.png" class="large-centre-img">
    <div class="container">
      <%- yield %>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
~~~

This is a master file, which all pages in the project will be based on. Pay close attention to this section:

~~~
  ...
    <div class="container">
      <%- yield %>
    </div>
  ...    
~~~

Each page will be based on this structure - which means the pages can be significantly simplified:

## index.ejs

In all of the above, notice how we no longer have an `<head>` section in any page, as it is part of the layout. Also, the body section and the container wrapper.

Make sure the site continues to work as expected.
