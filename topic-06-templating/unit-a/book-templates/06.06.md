# Secondary

In the partials folder, create the following new file:

##  `_secondary.ejs`

~~~
<div id="secondary">
  <h1>Weekly Deals</h1>
  <h2 class="special">Business Bundle</h2>
  <p>
    <img src="images/business.png" alt="Business Bundle" class="medium-right-img"> Here comes the next bundle for march.
    This time it's macware who publish a bundle. The so called macware Business Bundle contains 6 apps at a price of
    only €29.99 instead of €199.94. So you can save around 84%. </p>
  <h2 class="special">Insanity Deal</h2>
  <p>
    <img src="images/insanity.jpg" alt="Insanity Deal" class="medium-left-img"> With the new €5 Insanity Deals from
    Bundlehunt you receive every day a highly reduced app for €5 only with savings up to 75%. Not a real bundle but, as
    there are multiple apps for only €5 each, one new per day, for the days to come. </p>
</div>

Edit index.html, and replace the secondary section with an include of this new file:

## index.html

~~~
<div id="navigation">
  <ul id="menu">
    <li class="active"><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="apps.html">Apps</a></li>
