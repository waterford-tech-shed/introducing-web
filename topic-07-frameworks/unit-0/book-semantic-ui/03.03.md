# Grid

We have carefully used the new grid CSS standard in our project, but have now removed it to use Semantic UI. This framework has its own grid system:

- <https://fomantic-ui.com/collections/grid.html>

This is somewhat simpler to master, and has a number of features our implementation did not address.

Here is how we might revise `index.html` (not showing the contents of the article and the aside):

## index.ejs

~~~html
<%- include('./partials/_nav.ejs', {id : "home"}); %>
<main>
  <div class="ui grid">
    <div class="ui twelve wide column">
      <article>
      ...
      </article>
    </div>
    <div class="ui four wide column">
      ...
    </div>
  </div>
</main>
~~~

We are using the 16 grid system defined by Semantic-UI - and defining a 12 - 4 ratio between our main article and the included aside.

This is the complete page:

## index.ejs

~~~html
<%- include('./partials/_nav.ejs', {id : "home"}); %>
<main>
  <div class="ui grid">
    <div class="ui twelve wide column">
      <article>
